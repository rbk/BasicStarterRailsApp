# Brainstorm ( or at least a sprinkle..)
	- Blog: with markdown editor, uploads, themes(would be really cool, thinking multi user)
	- Embeddable forms: Iframe, Donator is big deal for GuRuStu!!!, form creator important, Paypal/Stripe, Email notifications
	- Shareaplan.com: Social media just for teachers! Alternative to GoogleDocs File sharing, twitter like feeds, lesson collaboration, chat, free accounts, Amazon EC2 for sure.
	- A personal blog
	- Blog, use Wordpress


# brainstorm 10/11/14
